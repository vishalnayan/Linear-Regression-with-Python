### Linear Regression

Linear Regression is an important topic in Machine learning, although its very prominent concept of statictics, and is widely used for many practical reasons in Data science and ML. 
Some imporant point regardin linear regression are 

- Linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response or dependent variable, and one or more explantory variables(independent variable).
- The case of one explanatory variable is known as **Simple linear regression**.
- For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called **Multiple linear regression**.
- In linear regression, the relationhips are modelled using linear predictor function, whose unknown models parameter are estimated based on the data. Such models are called **Linear model**
- It's wideldy used in many practical applications is because models which depend linearly on their unknown parameters are easier to fit than models which are non-linearly related to their parameters.


### Practical Scenarios
- If the goal is error reduction, forecasting, prediction, linear regression can be used to fit a predictive model to an observed dataset of values of the response and explantory variable.
- If the goal is to explain variation in the response variable that can be attributed to variation in the explanatory variables.
